# Squadron


PURPOSE:
The principle aim of this project is to help victims get in touch with any trusted personnel, in case of grave emergency.This system will prove beneficial designed for the ones who encounter a possibility of assault while traveling alone or distress/assaults while staying alone.It may leave out the people who are living together which omits the cause for external help and those people who travel using public transport and move along the general public as help is always present.
Emergencies could range from internal factors like heart attacks, seizures, and another health-related issue to external factors like physical assaults,sexual assaults, etc. 

METHODS:
The key aspect of this project is minimalism.Being an emergency system it is important to keep view level of the user less complicated. The project can be scaled to work with various other services like cabs, ambulances, and hospitals to provide immediate aid to the victim. For example, it can be integrated with Google Maps to create a local alert about the emergencies among the nearby device owners, serving them with coordinates of the victim. In case the person happens to be in a place with poor or no internet connectivity, GSM triangulation technique will be used to get the location information. We use biometric authentication to verify the person’s emergency as well as a brief countdown to prevent accidental triggers and false alarms. This project can ensure better response time for help to reach victims. The law enforcement agencies can use this platform to receive anonymous tips through real-time push notifications on crimes about to happen so that they can respond in time. 

CONCLUSION: 
Through this project, we aim to improve individual safety standards in smart and connected cities. Due to the presence of connected devices, it gets convenient for tracking elevated situations through the array of devices available at disposal, making the whole process seamless. Immediate aid can be provided to victims of such incidents which provides a sense of hope that “help is always coming“.
